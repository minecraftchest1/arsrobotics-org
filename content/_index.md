# About Us

We are the Athene Renaissance, and this is our program. We have two teams. A FIRST Tech Challenge team, and a FIRST Robotics Competition Team. Both are powered by FIRST, we are able to compete with teams around the world, grow our knowledge, and have fun while doing so. You can learn more at the FIRST website.
